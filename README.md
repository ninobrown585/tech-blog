# tech-blog
This is a project using Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize, and Handlebars to build a tech blog website. When the user first visits the tech blog website, they will see any existing blog posts. They may click on them to read the content and see any comments. They must be logged in to leave comments. If there are no existing blog posts, a message will display stating there are no blog posts. If the user clicks any navigation link besides Home, they will be prompted to login or sign up.
